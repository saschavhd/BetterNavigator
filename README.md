# Menu
Custom class for easily making multi-page discord Menus, dynmically being able to switch and other qol.

IN PROGRESS.

I personally heavily recommend checking out the (currently) undocumented discord.ext.menus from the original maker of the discord.py API (Rapptz)

https://github.com/Rapptz/discord-ext-menus

I bumped into this after making a similar but much simpler class for my own bot. The code inspired me to start rewriting my own within my own capabilities and knowledge of the API. The extension built by Rapptz is much better for general use and allows for many more possibilities, it's really great! I used a few of the things he does in my own code.
