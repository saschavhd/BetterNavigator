# Menu
Custom class for easily making dynamic multi-page discord Menus, with various user input possibilities such as text, reactions and selectors.

FINISHED BETA VERSION

I bumped into this after making a similar but much simpler class for my own bot. The code inspired me to start rewriting my own within my own capabilities and knowledge of the API. The extension built by Rapptz is much better for general use and allows for many more possibilities, it's really great! I used a few of the things he does in my own code.

UPDATE:

Since the arrival of discord-components, I heavily recommend checking these out as well!
A very clean implentation of everything you can do with this and more!
